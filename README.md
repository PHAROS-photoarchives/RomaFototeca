# RomaFototeca
Data and documentation from the Photographic Collection of the Bibliotheca Hertziana, Max Planck Institute for Art History, Rome, Italy.
This repository contains data examples for the PHAROS consortium and associated institutes for photographic resources with objects on fine arts. The exports come from a local image database, initially edited with HIDA software and transferred to XML in eXist-db. Data structure and contents follows the MIDAS handbook (Bove/Heusinger/Kailus) http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/3770/.
The updated XML data is provided within the online catalogue of the photographic collection: http://foto.biblhertz.it hosted by the Bibliotheca Hertziana. Data copies are transferred each year to the general database and DISKUS union catalog http://www.bildindex.de, hosted by Foto Marburg, together with the photo data from the Kunsthistorisches Institute at Florence.
